# Brevo (Sendinblue) Email Setup Guide

## Why Brevo?
Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) is perfect for transactional emails with:
- âœ… **300 emails per day FREE** (9,000/month)
- âœ… Professional email templates
- âœ… High deliverability rates
- âœ… Easy to set up
- âœ… Perfect for order confirmations, shipping notifications

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create a Brevo Account

1. Go to https://www.brevo.com
2. Click "Sign up free"
3. Fill in your details
4. Verify your email address

### 2. Get Your API Key

1. Log into your Brevo dashboard
2. Click your profile name (top right)
3. Go to **"SMTP & API"**
4. Click **"API Keys"** tab
5. Click **"Create a new API key"**
6. Give it a name: "FashionCenter Production"
7. Copy the API key (you'll only see it once!)

### 3. Configure Your .env.local File

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Brevo Email Configuration
BREVO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@fashioncenter.co.za

# Admin emails for order notifications
ADMIN_EMAIL_1=your_email@example.com
ADMIN_EMAIL_2=sister1_email@example.com
ADMIN_EMAIL_3=sister2_email@example.com
```

### 4. Verify Your Sender Email (Important!)

For emails to be sent successfully, you need to verify your sender domain:

#### Option A: Use Your Own Domain (Recommended)
1. In Brevo, go to **"Senders, Domains & Dedicated IPs"**
2. Click **"Add a domain"**
3. Enter your domain: `fashioncenter.co.za`
4. Follow the DNS verification steps (add SPF, DKIM records)
5. Wait for verification (usually 24-48 hours)

#### Option B: Use Brevo's Domain (Temporary)
1. Use `your-email@sendinblue.com` as sender email
2. This works immediately but looks less professional
3. Recommended only for testing

### 5. Test Your Email Setup

Run this test in your browser console or create a test page:

```javascript
// Test order confirmation email
const testOrderData = {
  orderNumber: 'TEST-001',
  customerName: 'Test Customer',
  customerEmail: 'your-test-email@example.com',
  total: 500.00,
  items: [
    { name: 'Test Product', quantity: 2, price: 250.00 }
  ],
  shippingAddress: '123 Test Street, Johannesburg, 2000'
};

// Send test email (you'll need to create an API endpoint for this)
fetch('/api/test-email', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(testOrderData)
});
```
